    <h2>Short Bio</h2>
      <p>I was born in southeast rural Pennsylvania somewhere between Philadelphia and the Amish country. I met my husband on the second day of school at Virginia Tech where I got my bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering. After graduation, we headed to St. Louis because Mark had a job offer from McDonnell Douglas. (I had a job offer as well but it was with Cummins Engines which was a manufacturing plant in the middle of Indiana surrounded literally by cornfields for miles and miles.) After five long turbulent years in St. Louis, we both had completed our master degrees and we were ready to move on to somewhere new in the USA. We headed west! Portland!
